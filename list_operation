'''Problem Statement:

You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:

Split into Even and Odd Lists: Separate the list into two new lists â€” one containing all the even numbers and the other containing all the odd numbers.
Sort Both Lists: Sort both the even and odd lists in descending order.
Merge the Lists: Merge the sorted even and odd lists back together, where all the even numbers appear before the odd numbers.
Calculate Product: Calculate the product of all numbers in the final merged list.
Example:

Input: [3, 6, 2, 7, 8, 5]

Output:

Even numbers: [8, 6, 2]
Odd numbers: [7, 5, 3]
Merged list: [8, 6, 2, 7, 5, 3]
Product: 10080'''

#code
numbers = [3, 6, 2, 7, 8, 5]
even = [num for num in numbers 
        if num % 2 == 0] # even 
odd = [num for num in numbers 
       if num % 2 != 0] # odd
even.sort(reverse=True)
odd.sort(reverse=True)
merged_list = even + odd
product = 1
for num in merged_list:
    product = product * num
print("Even numbers:", even)
print("Odd numbers:", odd)
print("Merged list:", merged_list)
print("Product:", product)
